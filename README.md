# Student Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using Python.
The goal is to understand how different factors such as study time,
attendance, and gender affect students' final exam results.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains academic and personal information of students, including:
- Gender
- Age
- Study time
- Number of absences
- Internal marks (G1, G2)
- Final grade (G3)

Total Records: 395 students  
Total Columns: 33 features

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Visual Studio Code

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Data loading and exploration
- Checking missing values
- Gender distribution analysis
- Pass/Fail classification based on final grade
- Study time vs performance analysis
- Absences vs final grade visualization

## 📈 Key Insights
- Students with higher study time tend to pass more.
- Higher number of absences is associated with lower final grades.
- Around two-thirds of students passed the final exam.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Make sure `students.csv` and `student_analysis.py` are in the same folder
3. Run the following command in terminal:

```bash
python student_analysis.py

Conclusion
This project helped me understand how student performance can be analyzed
using real data. From the analysis, it is clear that factors like study time
and attendance play an important role in final exam results. Working on this
project improved my understanding of data analysis, visualization, and how
insights can be drawn from datasets to support academic decision-making.
